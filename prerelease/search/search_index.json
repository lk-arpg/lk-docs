Loosely, this means that there are two persistent branches:</p> <ul> <li>The default/primary branch-- <code>main</code>, in this case-- which always contains the current release/the current stable version, and</li> <li>The development branch-- <code>develop</code>, in this case-- which always contains the latest work-- features, fixes, and so on. It is by definition unstable.<ul> <li>This branch is itself off of <code>main</code> and in the infrequent but possible event that the latter is updated directly (i.e. via a hotfix), <code>main</code> will be merged into it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>As well as three types of branches; each branch of these types is destined to be merged into another and is important but ultimately impermanent:</p> <ul> <li>Feature branches<ul> <li>These follow the naming scheme <code>feature/FEATURE-NAME-HERE</code>, e.g. <code>feature/two-factor-auth</code>.</li> <li>While these are called feature branches, they can contain new features and/or non-emergency bugfixes!</li> <li>New features are always merged into <code>develop</code> and <code>develop</code> only.</li> <li>These branches are created branched off of <code>develop</code> (if they contain features or there is no current release branch) or the current release branch (if there is one, and the feature branch contains only bugfixes for the current content within it).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Release branches<ul> <li>These follow the naming scheme <code>release/UPCOMING-VERSION-HERE</code>, e.g. <code>release/v2.0.0</code>.</li> <li>These are created by a maintainer of the repo when an upcoming release is feature-complete or otherwise ready, and are branched off of <code>develop</code>.</li> <li>Once they are created, no additional features or work from <code>develop</code> will be merged into these branches, only bugfixes for the features already in them.</li> <li>Conversely, bugfixes for features contained in a release branch are merged directly into the release branch and the release branch only. In the event that a release branch receives bugfixes, said release branch is periodically merged back into <code>develop</code> to incorporate them.</li> <li>In essence, the purpose of a release branch is to isolate, test, and if necessary fix a static set of features.</li> <li>When a release branch is sufficiently stable and any necessary preparations complete, the branch will be merged into <code>main</code> and become the new current release.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hotfix branches<ul> <li>These follow the naming scheme <code>hotfix/HOTFIX-NAME-HERE</code>.</li> <li>These contain emergency bugfixes, such as fixes for critical issues or security vulnerabilities.</li> <li>These are directly branched off of <code>main</code>/the current release and merged back into <code>main</code> when complete.</li> <li>In such an event, <code>main</code> is merged back into <code>develop</code> as well to incorporate fixes.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributing/#code-styling","title":"Code Styling","text":"<p>Contributions to Lorekeeper are recommended to follow the style of the project's existing code.

The function uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm to generate numbers\u2026which may be a familiar name if you play competitive Pokemon, as it's also the algorithm used in the game. For those who are unfamiliar: in the older versions of Pokemon, before features to make competitive battling accessible, serious players (and rare Pokemon collectors) would exploit the random number generation in the game to generate Pokemon with the exact stats and shininess they wanted. As you might realise... yes, this theoretically means you could do something similar.</p> <p>There is a very big caveat, though, in that you need to have specific information in order to do it. In a Pokemon game, you have access to the entire game and your own game console. In a game running on someone else\u2019s web server, a lot of the details are out of your reach.</p> <p>Going a bit further into detail: random number generators, surprisingly, are not random. (Thus, they're more accurately called pseudo-random number generators.) An algorithm will always produce the same output given the same input. That\u2019s one of the foundations of mathematics. It's how you can take someone\u2019s Minecraft seed and generate exactly the same world on your computer. That concept, the \u201cseed\u201d is the important part - it\u2019s the input that generates the predictable output, and if you know both the seed and algorithm, you can know the outcome.</p> <p>How difficult is it to find the seed, then? Well, it happens that PHP's code is available online and the question has come up before. The seed value is a function of the current timestamp, the PHP process PID and a value produced by PHP's internal LCG.<sup>1</sup> In simpler terms, anyone looking to exploit this would need 1. to know when exactly the number will be rolled, 2. to know some details that are known only to someone with access to the server/website setup, 3. a certain amount of data. 1 and 2 in particular are going to be unpredictable - the first requires knowing when exactly (to the second) your mods will approve a submission for example, and the second requires being able to run commands on your server (yikes!!!!!) and knowing how your loot tables are set up. Information could be gained from monitoring randomised data to reverse engineer some information about the MT - which, again, will probably tell nothing without knowledge of how the site data is set up.</p> <p>I won't say it's entirely uncrackable - but if you do have someone with that amount of knowledge, determination and time to spend cracking your game, I feel you may have significantly bigger problems than game balance. Effectively speaking, in terms of monetary value of time vs monetary value of potential rewards to be gained, the odds that someone would jump through all these hoops to predict your game's rolls are extremely low.</p>"},{"location":"features/randomness/#fairness-of-rolls","title":"Fairness of Rolls","text":"<p>I don't think the actual issue is that people think the RNG is broken because it keeps rolling the same result. It's probably that it keeps rolling the same negative result. Nevertheless, the uniformity of rolls can be fairly easily verified: rolling a large enough pool of numbers and counting how often each one shows up will yield a spread that shows that none of them are significantly more likely to be rolled than any other.</p> <p>The verification can be done by yourself in simple PHP - roll a million numbers from, say, 0 to 9 and output the counts. Paste this code here for a quick test.</p> <pre><code>$numbers = array_fill(0, 10, 0);\nfor ($i = 0; $i &lt; 1000000; $i++) {\n    $numbers[mt_rand(0, 9)]++;\n}\nforeach($numbers as $number=&gt;$count) {\n    echo \"Rolled {$number}: {$count} times&lt;br /&gt;\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Each number will be rolled close to 100000 times. The deviation is not particularly significant, and the significance decreases the more times you roll. On the other hand, the fewer times you roll, the more likely it is that you get results that look skewed.</p> <p>The important thing to note is that someone rolling a bad result 10 times in a row is not indicative of the code being buggy - unlikely as 10 consecutive fails at a 50% rate is, a possibility is still a possibility. That's how probability works - if you roll bad results you're not necessarily due for something good in the near future, but in the big scheme of things, it'll even itself out eventually.</p>"},{"location":"features/randomness/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>In the context of a small game, for the purposes Lorekeeper was intended for, a cryptographically secure random number generator would not be noticeably better than PHP's built-in, non-cryptographically-secure <code>mt_rand()</code> if at all.

However, just like in social situations, context is important, and in this context none of these points concern 1. your credit card number 2. any perceivable advantage someone may stand to gain in a reasonable amount of time with a reasonable amount of misguided effort.

For contribution guidelines, see here.</p> <p>The first and most important thing to understand about Lorekeeper is that it is not one single project; the \"core\" repository exists, but does not represent many (if any) sites which run it. To express it a different way, it is one project with a thousand forks, and work on it-- both on the core project and individual sites-- must keep this in mind.</p> <p>Functionally, this is a consequence of the nature of the sites involved; each will want to have its own unique look and feel, tailored to the ARPG it hosts, and may have any number of features that have been developed as \"extensions\". In essence, each site is as much of a creative endeavor as it is a piece of software; while the core project provides the foundation, it is more or less expected that site operators make it their own.</p>"},{"location":"guides/dev-intro/#extensions-and-other-changes","title":"Extensions and Other Changes","text":"<p>There are many features that site operators might want for their ARPGs that aren't necessarily fit for inclusion in the core project. For instance, some features might fit a certain type of game but not others. In order to meet some of the more common needs (among other reasons), some members of the community have opted to write and publish additional features or modifications for core Lorekeeper. These are referred to as \"extensions\"; examples of these can be viewed on the extensions wiki.</p> <p>From a technical perspective, however, Lorekeeper has no \"plugin\" support or similar. Instead, extensions are provided as git branches-- modified copies of core Lorekeeper that can be added to a given site by means of merging the branch with git. This process, as with any other site-specific modifications, often results in conflicts (including with updates to the core project). However, given the extensiveness of changes some sites may want to make, it would be difficult to create and maintain a sufficiently robust \"plugin\" system, if not impossible.</p> <p>As a consequence, while you are free to do whatever you please to your own site, development environment, and so on, if you want to leverage the wealth of community-developed features and modifications you will want to maintain some amount of continuity with core Lorekeeper (on which extensions are based). For instance, significantly altering the formatting of code within the project is an easy way to create significant grief for yourself even without changing any functionality.</p>"},{"location":"guides/dev-intro/#navigating-branches","title":"Navigating Branches","text":"<p>In short, Lorekeeper has 2-3 persistent branches at any given time:</p> <ul> <li><code>main</code>, which contains the current stable release</li> <li><code>develop</code>, which contains the latest in-development version</li> <li><code>release/v**</code> (e.g. <code>release/v3.0.0</code>), which contains the testing version of the next/upcoming release</li> </ul> <p>Standard guidance is to base a live site on either <code>main</code> or a release branch if one exists, as neither of these options will receive new features, only hotfixes or bugfixes respectively.</p> <p>If you have existing development experience, you may be tempted to work with <code>develop</code> as the basis for a live site. While this is already not recommended for the usual and customary reasons of it being unstable and not yet thoroughly tested, there is another reason: standard guidance when developing extensions is likewise to target the current stable release/base that work on <code>main</code>.

This also tends to mean fewer bugs, as ideally most are caught and fixed before a a new version is released, and the lack of change means new bugs don't occur. Conversely, <code>develop</code> is the exact opposite: it always has the latest features, updates, etc.! Of course, this means that it always has the latest bugs. Similarly, new releases-- or updates to <code>main</code>-- happen relatively infrequently, while <code>develop</code> may be updated and added to at any time!</p> <p>There are also three different types of branches.
