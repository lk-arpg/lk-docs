## v1.0.0: Initial release
### Miscellaneous
- Fixed the wording on image uploads
- Added a missing notification to the recipient of a direct character transfer

- Trade comments were not being displayed correctly
- Users without the required power were still able to view the sort images button on a character's page
- If an image was uploaded for a non-visible character, the owner would still get a notification
