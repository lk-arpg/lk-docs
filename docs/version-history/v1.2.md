# v1.2.x
This page contains all updates made for version 1.2.0 of Lorekeeper.

## v1.2.0: Bug fixes, feature update, minor changes
### New Additions
- Enable collapsing elements w/ bootstrap.
- Note that HTMLPurifier caches, so changes may not be readily apparent; see [https://github.com/itinerare/lorekeeper/tree/None-Cache](https://github.com/itinerare/lorekeeper/tree/None-Cache) for the version of the config with caching disabled. Theoretically this should be a temporary measure, but given that it'll appear to folk that the changes didn't take, I'm not sure how best to handle it. ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))

### Miscellaneous
- On the Currencies admin panel, change the edit link(s) to be a button at the end of each row to be more consistent with other admin panels ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))
- Add link to subtypes to world index page ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))
- Hide mobile menu on pages without sidebar content ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))
- Adjust layering of mobile menu and navbar to fix an issue with certain elements appearing over the mobile menu ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))
- Collapse nested links in world sidebar header to be cleaner and more consistent with other sidebars ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))

### Bug Fixes
- Put back missing button to edit image notes ([PR #11](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper/pull/11))
