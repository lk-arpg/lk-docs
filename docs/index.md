!!! warning "WIP"

    This is the documentation for the upcoming release of Lorekeeper. As a consequence of the transition to this documentation site and the restructuring of significant parts of the documentation, it is heavily WIP; there may be incomplete or obsolete information, broken links, and so on. Please bear with us while we assemble a new, more usable, and more easily maintainable version of the docs!

    Likewise, if you're interested in contributing to the documentation, it's very welcome! See [Issues](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lk-docs/issues) on the documentation repository for tracking necessary updates.

Lorekeeper is an open-source framework for managing ARPGs/closed species masterlists built using the Laravel framework. In simple terms - you will be able to make your own Lorekeeper site, perform setup/enter data about your species and game, and it'll provide you with the automation to keep track of your species, players and ARPG submissions.

Lorekeeper is free and open-source, which means it's free for you to use and modify to your needs. Please see the links below for instructions on setting up!
