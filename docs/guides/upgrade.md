# Upgrade Guide

!!! example "WIP"

    This is a WIP version of the upgrade guide for Lorekeeper v3.0. Do not use as a reference at this time.

As of v3.0, Lorekeeper requires **PHP 8.1**. No other requirements are changed. For a list of changes included in v3.0, see the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md).

### Summary

- Update your site or server to use PHP 8.1
- Pull the updates, resolving any merge conflicts as appropriate
- Make any config file changes
- (Recommended) Put your site in maintenance mode via `php artisan down`
- Push updates
- Run `composer update` or equivalent and then `php artisan update-lorekeeper-v3`
- (Recommended) Verify that no errors have occurred and use `php artisan up` to remove your site from maintenance mode
- Perform any configuration desired within the site

### Full Guide

Note that this guide assumes hosting on Dreamhost; guides for other hosts will be linked as created by community members. This guide also assumes a basic knowledge of git; see [Tutorial: Introduction To Git](https://wiki.lorekeeper.me/index.php?title=Tutorial:_Introduction_To_Git) if you need to review.

#### Updating your site to PHP 8.1

Note that this assumes your site is currently running PHP 7.4 as recommended for the previous version of Lorekeeper. If you are already running PHP 8.1, you can skip this step. To check, you may consult the Dreamhost control panel and enter `php -v` into PuTTY to check your PHP version.

1. In the Dreamhost control panel, navigate to Domains > Manage Domains via the sidebar
2. Click "Edit" for your site (under "Web Hosting")
3. Under "Web Options", select one of the PHP 8.1 options for "PHP Mode"
4. Click "Change settings". Allow 5-10 minutes or so for changes to process
5. To verify changes, enter `php -v` into PuTTY

If after this php -v returns PHP 7.4 or others, follow these steps in PuTTY to update it (courtesy of[ this guide in the Lorekeeper Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/678909186683437056/763287225839779842/795023074574729216)):

1. Enter `cd ~` to ensure you are in your user directory
2. Enter `nano .bash_profile`. This will open this file in the editor
3. Add `export PATH=/usr/local/php81/bin:$PATH` to the end of the file
4. Save the file by pressing ctrl+x, y, and then enter
5. Enter `. ~/.bash_profile` to update the file you just saved
6. Enter `php -v` again to verify that the update has worked

If this does not resolve the issue, contact support.

#### Pulling Updates

Pull updates from the [Lorekeeper repo](https://github.com/lk-arpg/lorekeeper)'s `main` branch on GitHub. You may have renamed this remote to "origin-old" as part of the set up process.

You may encounter merge conflicts as a result of this. Please see [Tutorial: Installing Extensions - Merging Conflicts](https://wiki.lorekeeper.me/index.php?title=Tutorial:_Installing_Extensions#Merging_Conflicts) for information on how to resolve them. If you did not, or did and have resolved all extant conflicts, commit your changes (if you have not already).

You may wish to make changes to config files now, though you can do so later as well if desired (more information on added configuration options and settings is included later in this guide). If you wish to make changes now, it's recommended you review the following files and change settings as desired:

- `config/lorekeeper/settings`
    - The pre-existing settings file. Additional options have been added in keeping with the addition of extensions from modified-main, etc.
- `config/lorekeeper/extensions`
- `config/lorekeeper/sites`
    - Controls which sites may be used for authentication as well as assisting with link formatting for other sites. Note that any site enabled for auth must also be configured on that platform. See [Social Media Authentication](socmed/index.md) for instructions for supported sites. You may wish to prepare any additional sites you wish to use as an auth option before continuing with the update.

If/when you are ready, commit any changes to config files.

#### Pushing Updates

1. Connect to your site's server via SSH and navigate to your site's `www` directory (`cd ~/site-name.com/www`)
2. **Recommended:** Before pushing any updates to your site, enter `php artisan down` to put your site in maintenance mode. This will prevent any users from making changes while updates are being run, which helps minimize the risk of issues occurring during the update process.
3. Push the changes to your site
4. Enter `composer update` (if you installed composer globally) or `php composer.phar update` (if you installed composer locally only)
5. Enter `php artisan update-lorekeeper-v3`. This will run a variety of commands to update Lorekeeper and any existing data in your site for v3.
6. If you put your site in maintenance mode earlier, enter `php artisan up` to put it back up
7. Verify that no errors have occurred

Your site will now be updated and available to configure as desired.

#### Configuration

Configuration options and settings added as part of this update are listed here for convenience. For additional extension-specific configuration information, consult the extension's documentation.
