# Hiring Developers

Often, Lorekeeper owners will find themselves in need of additional development help to build or maintain their site. Whether it's a one-time request or ongoing maintenance, hiring the right developer(s) can make a significant difference in the success of your project.

We recommend reading the [Getting Hired Guide](getting-hired.md) if you're a developer looking to work on Lorekeeper projects. It's also a good resource for project owners to understand what to expect from developers.

If planning on hiring multiple developers, we recommend reading [Working With Multiple Developers](working-with-multiple-devs.md) first and understanding the best practices for collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before hiring a developer, ensure you have the following in place:

-  Have a clear understanding of what work you want done *before* looking to hire a developer.
-  Make sure you understand what circumstances any potential work is being done under.  
**What does that mean?**
    - Is the work private, or will it become public at some time after completion? When?
    - Check (or ask) up front if the person you’re working with has a Terms of Service (ToS)!
        - If they do, make sure you read and understand it before agreeing to work with them.
        - If they don’t, consider asking them to create one. It protects both parties.

        !!! danger
            Remember that a ToS is not a polite request for people to abide by if they feel like it.
            It exists for the mutual safety of you *and* your developer(s); be ready both to abide by it, *and*, if need be, enforce it.

## Where to Find Developers

1. **Lorekeeper Discord:** The official Lorekeeper Discord server has a community of developers who may be available for hire. You can post in the appropriate channels to find interested parties.
2. **Toyhou.se:** This platform has a section for seeking services.

!!! warning
    Be extremely cautious when hiring developers from third party platforms. Ensure the developer has relevant experience. We personally DO NOT recommend hiring developers without prior Lorekeeper experience, as the learning curve can be steep.

## What to Look For
When hiring developers for your Lorekeeper site, consider the following:

- **Experience with Lorekeeper:** Familiarity with the project can significantly reduce onboarding time.
- **Portfolio:** Review their past work to gauge their skill level, particularly if you have tight deadlines or specific requirements in mind. See what other work the person you’re working with has done that is in line with what you’re looking to commission.
    - This can help make sure that potential work done is of good quality, as well as in the vein you’re looking for (depending on the nature of the potential commission).
- **References:** If possible, speak with previous clients for further insight.

## Setting Expectations
Before starting work, ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of:

- **Scope of Work:** Define what tasks need to be completed clearly. Consider using a task management tool to track progress.

- **Access:** Determine what access the developer will need (e.g., GitHub, hosting, etc.)

- **Timeline:** Set realistic deadlines for deliverables.
    - While it’s reasonable to ask for updates, please keep in mind that those you’re working with also have their own lives, and may do other work even in the midst of your commission.
    - Abide by their ToS if it has instructions for this, or otherwise ask after updates about once a week at most frequent (as a baseline).

- **Payment Terms:** Agree on rates and payment schedules.
    - While this might seem obvious for work that costs a flat fee, when dealing with programming work, it’s just as likely that it’s charged at an hourly rate.
    - Make sure you’re aware of which it is, and if dealing with an hourly rate, how long the work will potentially take. In short, get an estimate/ask for a quote!

    !!! warning
        You should do this before committing to anything.
