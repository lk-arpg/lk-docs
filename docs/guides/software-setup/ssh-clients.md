# SSH Client Setup

!!! example "WIP"

    Please include information here for Mac and Linux.

SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) is used to securely connect from your local computer to a remote server. It is required to interact with your live version of Lorekeeper.

## Windows

For Windows, the preferred SSH client is PuTTY.

1. Go [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to download PuTTY. Click the highlighted link to download it -- for most cases, you want the "64-bit x86" version.

2. We're going to click through the screens to install PuTTY. Click "Next", leaving all settings as default, until you reach the "Install" button.

4. When you installed PuTTY, it also installs a software called PuTTYgen. Open up this software.

5. It should look like this when opened. We are going to press the "Generate" button.

6. Wiggle your mouse around as instructed!

7. Save both your Public and Private key to somewhere safe on your computer. **The key is shown in this image for example's sake, but do not share your key publicly!** It's better to have people set up their own keys than to share yours.

You will use these keys when [configuring your live server](../setup-index.md#webserver-live-set-up).
