# Getting Hired (for Developers)

Thank you to [itinerare](https://github.com/itinerare) for providing the basis of this guide!

Lorekeeper as a whole is a very artist centered community. While code commissions have points in common with (likely more familiar) art commissions, they also have differences that can make for some pitfalls— both for those taking commissions and for those commissioning work.

If you're looking to hire individuals for your project, we recommend reading [Hiring Developers](hiring-devs.md) first to understand what to look for and how to set expectations. If you want to get hired, we also recommend reading this! It will help you understand some of the concerns project owners may have and recommended practices to follow.

## Before Getting Hired

Before taking on any work, make sure you have the following in place:

- Aim to communicate to the best of your ability, including when delays occur.
- Be clear about what you can and cannot do (or will or will not do, depending) and what specific types of work you’re taking on.
    - This both sets clear expectations and may help provide clarity for potential commissioners who may not have the same background and understanding of what work they’re looking for.
- Provide some examples of your prior work!
    - These might take the form of extension(s) or site-specific features you’ve developed, layout or CSS work you’ve done, etc.
    - This both demonstrates your abilities and helps make sure potential commissioners have clear expectations about what kind of work you can do/have done.
- Be clear about your rates and payment terms.
    - Do you charge a flat fee or hourly rate? If hourly, what is your rate?
- Have a Terms of Service (ToS), and make sure that anyone you’re working with agrees to it in writing!
    - If you don’t have one, consider creating one. It protects both parties.
    - Also make sure that it is readily accessible e.g. outside of Discord and can be linked to and/or referenced easily.

In fact, the ToS is so important that we recommend not working with anyone who does not have one, or who refuses to agree to yours. In fact, it is so so important, we are going to have an entire section dedicated to it:

### Terms of Service (ToS)
The purpose of this document is manifold.

Broadly, it should communicate:

- Your expectations for a commissioner.
- What expectations a commissioner can have of you.  
**And more specifically:**
    - Under what circumstances work is being done, on what timetable(s), etc.
    - How are changes handled? What about additional work?
    - How is payment expected? When is it expected?
    - If you have a non-flat-fee cost for something, how is that handled?
    - Do you take payment plans for work costing larger amounts? how does that work, if so?
    - How do you handle refunds? Under what circumstances will you issue one? How much is it?

It’s also worth having something akin to a very finite warranty included in your ToS.

That is to say, it’s generally reasonable to promise that code works as intended at the outset/on delivery, and resolve any issues that come up in that context.

However, it’s not practical to be responsible for its maintenance in perpetuity, especially if it breaks as a consequence of others’ actions, updates, etc.

!!! warning
    Note that this does not necessarily preclude you from taking on additional work to maintain it, including for pay, just absolve you of the obligation to do so.

!!! danger
    Remember that your ToS is not a polite request for people to abide by if they feel like it.
    It exists for the mutual safety of you *and* your commissioner(s); be ready both to abide by it, *and*, if need be, enforce it.
